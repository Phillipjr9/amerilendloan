**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the AmeriLend website and services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "your," or "Borrower") and AmeriLend ("we," "us," "our," or "Lender"). Please read these Terms carefully before using our Services.

## 2. Eligibility

To use our Services and apply for a loan, you must:

By submitting a loan application, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements and that all information provided is accurate, complete, and current.

## 3. Loan Application Process

### 3.1 Application Submission

You may submit a loan application through our online platform. The application requires personal information, employment details, financial information, and the purpose of the loan. All information must be accurate and truthful.

### 3.2 Application Review

We review all applications and make lending decisions based on our underwriting criteria, which may include credit history, income verification, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. We reserve the right to approve, deny, or request additional information for any application.

### 3.3 Loan Approval

If your application is approved, we will notify you of the approved loan amount, interest rate, repayment terms, and processing fee. Approval does not guarantee disbursement until all conditions are met.

## 4. Processing Fees

### 4.1 Fee Requirement

All approved loans require payment of a processing fee before funds can be disbursed. The processing fee is calculated as a percentage of the approved loan amount (typically 1.5% to 2.5%) or as a fixed fee, as determined by our current fee structure.

### 4.2 Fee Payment

Processing fees must be paid in full before loan disbursement. We accept payment via:
- Credit or debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover)
- Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, USDC)

### 4.3 Non-Refundable

Processing fees are non-refundable once paid, except as required by applicable law. The fee covers administrative costs, underwriting, and processing services.

## 5. Loan Terms

### 5.1 Loan Types

We offer two types of loans:

Repayment terms vary by loan type and amount. You agree to repay the loan according to the schedule provided in your loan agreement. Payments are typically due monthly on a specified date.
