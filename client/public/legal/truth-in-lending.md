## KEY DISCLOSURES

### 1. Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

The APR is the cost of your credit expressed as a yearly rate. Your APR will be determined based on your creditworthiness, loan amount, and loan term. The APR includes:

- Interest charges
- Origination fee (if applicable)

**APR Range:** 5.99% – 35.99%

> The APR disclosed to you before loan signing will remain fixed for the life of the loan. AmeriLend does not offer variable-rate consumer loans.

### 2. Finance Charge

The **Finance Charge** is the dollar amount the credit will cost you over the full term of the loan. It includes:

- Total interest paid over the life of the loan
- Origination fee (if applicable)

Your exact Finance Charge will be disclosed in your Loan Agreement prior to signing.

### 3. Amount Financed

The **Amount Financed** is the amount of credit provided to you or on your behalf. This is the loan principal minus any prepaid finance charges (such as an origination fee deducted at disbursement).

### 4. Total of Payments

The **Total of Payments** is the total amount you will have paid after making all scheduled payments. It equals:

> **Total of Payments = Amount Financed + Finance Charge**
